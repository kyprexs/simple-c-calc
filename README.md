# Advanced C++ Calculator

## Overview
This is an advanced calculator program written in C++. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced operations like exponentiation, square root, and factorial.

## Features
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root, and factorial.
- Handles division by zero and negative inputs for square root and factorial operations.
- Saves all calculations and results to a text file named "calculator_history.txt".
- Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting expressions and viewing results.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter an expression in the format `number1 operator number2`, where `operator` can be `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` (exponentiation).
3. Press Enter to see the result.
4. After each calculation, the program will prompt you if you want to do another calculation. Enter `y` to continue or `n` to quit.
5. All calculations and results are saved to the file "calculator_history.txt" in the same directory as the program.

## Examples
- To perform addition: `5 + 3`
- To perform subtraction: `10 - 7`
- To perform multiplication: `4 * 6`
- To perform division: `9 / 3`
- To perform exponentiation: `2 ^ 3`
- To calculate square root: `sqrt(16)` (Enter `16 ^ 0.5`)
- To calculate factorial: `5!` (Enter `5 ^ 5`)

## Dependencies
- This program requires a C++ compiler that supports C++11 standard or later.
